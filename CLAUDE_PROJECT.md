### **🛠️ Essential Commands**

#### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Install dependencies and start development
npm install
npm run dev              # Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:web          # Frontend only (Vite dev server)
npm run dev:api          # Backend only (Python development)

# Build and quality checks
npm run build            # Build all workspaces
npm run test             # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint             # Lint all workspaces
npm run type-check       # TypeScript type checking

# Single test execution
cd apps/web && npm run test -- ClaimsValidation  # Frontend component test
cd apps/api && python -m pytest tests/test_claims_service.py::test_specific_function  # Backend unit test
```

#### **Demo Lifecycle (Steel-Thread)**
```bash
# Complete demo deployment
make demo                # Deploy infrastructure + application
make validate-demo       # Verify end-to-end functionality
make cleanup            # Destroy all resources (cost control)

# Development testing
make test-steel-thread   # Run backend integration tests with fixtures
make check-costs        # Monitor AWS spending
```

#### **Infrastructure Management**
```bash
# Terraform operations
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy        # Cost cleanup

# AWS deployment
make deploy-infrastructure  # Terraform deployment
make deploy-application     # Code deployment to Lambda/S3
```

### **🏗️ Architecture Insights**

#### **Monorepo Structure & Type Sharing**
This is a critical architectural pattern:
- **Shared types**: `packages/shared/src/types/` contains TypeScript interfaces that are compiled to both TS and Python
- **Import pattern**: Frontend uses `import { HealthcareClaim } from '@healthcare-ai/shared'`
- **Backend usage**: Python models inherit from shared type definitions
- **Why important**: Prevents type drift between frontend/backend in healthcare data validation

#### **AI Integration Architecture**
Two-tier AI validation system:
1. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Medical reasoning and clinical necessity validation
2. **NVIDIA AI Enterprise**: Compliance checking and regulatory validation
3. **Cost control**: Built-in budget monitoring with $50 demo limit
4. **Fallback strategy**: Graceful degradation when AI APIs fail during executive demos

#### **Steel-Thread Implementation**
Backend-first development approach:
- **Core Lambda**: `apps/api/src/handlers/claims_validator.py` orchestrates entire workflow
- **Service Layer**: AI integration in `apps/api/src/services/ai_service.py`
- **Data Models**: Shared between frontend/backend via `packages/shared/`
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform manages complete AWS stack with cost controls

#### **Cost Control Architecture**
- **Budget enforcement**: Real-time cost tracking with automatic shutoff
- **Resource lifecycle**: S3 auto-deletion after 7 days, DynamoDB TTL enabled
- **Demo optimization**: Infrastructure designed for <5 minute deploy→demo→cleanup cycle

#### **Healthcare Compliance Patterns**
- **HIPAA considerations**: No PII in logs, structured audit trails
- **Medical codes**: CPT, ICD-10 validation in shared constants
- **Executive presentation**: Healthcare-specific terminology and business metrics

### **🔧 Environment Setup**
```bash
# Required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Required for AI integration
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Required for compliance validation
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"          # Required for AWS resources
```
