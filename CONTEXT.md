## 📚 **Documentation Architecture (CRITICAL STANDARD)**

### **Modular CLAUDE.md Structure**
1. **CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL.md**: Universal development methodology (reusable across projects)
2. **CLAUDE_PROJECT.md**: Healthcare AI-specific context and business requirements
3. **CLAUDE.md**: Lightweight reference hub importing specialized files

### **Pre-Commit Documentation Validation (MANDATORY)**
**The Critic's Standard**: *"Documentation inconsistencies are INEXCUSABLE in production-ready systems"*

#### **Required Validation Checklist (BEFORE EVERY GIT COMMIT)**
```bash
# MANDATORY validation patterns:
make check-env                    # Verify environment requirements match docs
make validate-steel-thread       # Confirm system works as documented
grep -r "make demo" README.md     # Should return ZERO matches (use deploy-steel-thread)
grep -r "OPENAI_API_KEY.*=" README.md  # Verify API key format matches validation
```

#### **Documentation Standards Enforced**
1. ✅ README.md environment variables match Makefile check-env requirements exactly
2. ✅ All Makefile target references use action-based naming conventions
3. ✅ API key formats match validation requirements (OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...")
4. ✅ Installation commands and demo lifecycle instructions work as documented
5. ✅ Git commit messages are clean and professional (NO Claude attribution)

## 🔧 **Environment Management (AWS STANDARDS)**

### **Required Environment Variables (VALIDATED)**
```bash
# Core API Keys (REQUIRED for real AI integration)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key-here"     # REQUIRED - OpenAI GPT-4
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your-nvidia-key"             # OPTIONAL - Enhanced compliance

# AWS Credentials (REQUIRED for infrastructure)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"  
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"                       # Or AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
```

### **Environment Crisis Resolution**
**Problem Solved**: Environment variables were scattered across 14 files with inconsistent naming
**Solution Implemented**: Single source of truth with comprehensive validation and clear error messages

## 🎯 **Development Methodology (STEEL-THREAD)**

### **Backend-First Approach**
1. **Core Infrastructure First**: AWS Lambda + OpenAI integration
2. **Test Harness Driven**: Automated pytest with realistic healthcare fixtures  
3. **Vertical Integration**: End-to-end working system at each step
4. **Professional Quality**: No mocks, no shortcuts, no technical debt

### **Makefile-Driven Development**
- **Philosophy**: "From now on we live in the Makefile which will drive end-to-end testing"
- **Zero Manual Commands**: All operations automated through professional targets
- **Dependency Management**: Proper build sequences and error handling
