🚀 **Launching AI Claims Validation Reference Implementation: Steel-Thread Architecture with Real Business Impact!**

Hey LinkedIn fam! As an engineer passionate about learn-by-doing, I'm excited to kick off a series of reference implementations using steel-thread methodology. This approach delivers vertical slices for quick, meaningful results—perfect for mastering AI and DevOps.

**Kicking off with:**
• **5 AI Refs Across Industries**: Laser-focused demos showing real potential.
• **DevOps/DevSecOps Refs**: Operational excellence via the same method.

All open-source in my [engineering portfolio](https://github.com/basilan/bb-engineering-portfolio). Let's dive into the first one!

**🏥 AI Claims Validation in Action:** Not a POC— a production-ready app you can clone and run. Processed 30 real medical claims, saving $3,639. Deployed for <$0.01 with auto-cleanup!

**What it demos:**
• Real OpenAI GPT-4 for medical reasoning (no mocks!)
• Full AWS serverless stack (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway)
• Steel-thread from Epic 1: End-to-end functionality
• Makefile automation for pro workflows
• Cost controls & auto-teardown
• Security scans baked in

**📊 Tangible Results (See attached dashboard screenshot):**
• 64% cost reduction
• 2.1s avg processing (vs. 8-10 mins manual)
• $121 ROI per claim
• 97.9% compliance
• Under $50 budget total

**Why this stands out as a ref impl:**
✅ Integrates real AI APIs from day 1
✅ Tackles tough problems first
✅ Dev-friendly automation
✅ Exec-trusted cost/security
✅ Med-grade practices

**🔗 Get Hands-On:**
• **Repo**: [biriGov](https://github.com/basilan/biriGov)
• **Portfolio**: [bb-engineering-portfolio](https://github.com/basilan/bb-engineering-portfolio)
• **Guide**: [BB_AI_REFERENCE_APP_EPIC1_BODY.md](https://github.com/basilan/biriGov/blob/main/docs/BB_AI_REFERENCE_APP_EPIC1_BODY.md)

This is #1 of 5 AI refs—each teaching production AI facets. **What would YOU build on this? Facing AI challenges? Share below!**

Companion post on AI dev practices coming soon. Shoutout to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [bmad-method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), [Paul Duvall's tools](https://github.com/PaulDuvall/claude-code/), and upcoming lessons (teaser: Add a "skeptic" persona to your coding!).

**Feedback welcome**: What resonates? Ideas for future refs in AI/DevOps?
