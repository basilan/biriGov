# Story 1.1: Healthcare AI Claims Validation Steel-Thread Foundation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Healthcare Executive evaluating AI governance capabilities,
**I want** a complete working healthcare claims validation system that can be deployed, demonstrated, and cleaned up within 5 minutes,
**so that** I can evaluate technical credibility and business value of AI-powered healthcare cost reduction (60% savings demonstration).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete Infrastructure Deployment**: System deploys all AWS resources (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront) via single `make demo` command within 60 seconds
2. **Working Claims Validation**: Process demo healthcare claim (CT scan for chronic back pain) using OpenAI GPT-4 medical reasoning and return validation results within 2 minutes
3. **Executive Dashboard Interface**: React SPA displays validation results with confidence scores, cost reduction metrics, and processing time in healthcare-professional styling
4. **NVIDIA Compliance Integration**: Integrate NVIDIA AI Enterprise API for compliance checking and governance validation of claims processing
5. **Audit Trail Generation**: All validation decisions logged to CloudWatch with timestamps, user context, and AI reasoning for regulatory compliance demonstration
6. **Cost Tracking & Budget Control**: Real-time cost tracking displayed in dashboard with automatic shutdown if approaching $50 demonstration budget
7. **Complete Cleanup Automation**: `make cleanup` command executes Terraform destroy and confirms zero ongoing AWS costs within 60 seconds
8. **Comprehensive Testing**: 85% test coverage with pytest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) including OpenAI/NVIDIA API mocking
9. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: 2-stage pipeline (Build/Test → Deploy/Validate) with automated quality gates and deployment validation
10. **Executive Presentation Ready**: System generates screenshot-ready validation results and cost savings summary suitable for stakeholder presentations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the **steel-thread methodology** from AGENTS.md, delivering complete end-to-end functionality from Epic 1 that can be progressively enhanced in later epics. The system must demonstrate **complete lifecycle capability** (deploy → validate → cleanup) while maintaining the <$50 budget constraint.

### Technology Stack (from docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, TypeScript 5.2.2, Tailwind CSS 3.3.3, Vite 4.4.9
- **Backend**: Python 3.11.5, FastAPI 0.103.1, AWS Lambda with python3.11 runtime
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform 1.5.7, AWS services (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Python SDK 1.3.0, NVIDIA AI Enterprise (latest)
- **Testing**: pytest 7.4.2, Vitest 0.34.2, Playwright 1.37.1

### Critical Implementation Requirements
1. **Cost Control by Design**: All AWS resources must have auto-cleanup policies and budget alerts
2. **Healthcare Compliance**: HIPAA-aware logging (no patient identifiers in logs)
3. **Demonstration Optimization**: 5-minute cycle requirement drives all architectural decisions
4. **AI Integration Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback responses for OpenAI/NVIDIA APIs
5. **Executive Credibility**: Professional healthcare styling and business metrics prioritization

### External Dependencies & User Responsibilities
- **User Provides**: OpenAI API key, NVIDIA AI Enterprise API access, AWS credentials
- **Agent Handles**: All code implementation, testing, infrastructure configuration
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time tracking with automatic shutdown at $45 (safety margin)

### Testing
#### Test File Organization
- **Frontend Tests**: `apps/web/__tests__/components/claims/ClaimValidator.test.tsx`
- **Backend Tests**: `apps/api/tests/handlers/test_claims_validator.py`
- **E2E Tests**: `e2e/tests/demo-workflow.spec.ts`

#### Testing Standards
- **Coverage Requirement**: 85% minimum across all code
- **Mock External APIs**: Use moto for AWS services, custom mocks for OpenAI/NVIDIA
- **Test Data**: Use realistic healthcare claims from packages/shared/src/test-data/
- **Integration Testing**: Full workflow testing with mocked external services

#### Testing Frameworks
- **Backend**: pytest with async support, moto for AWS mocking
