# Story 1.1: Healthcare AI Claims Validation Steel-Thread Foundation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Healthcare Executive evaluating AI governance capabilities,
**I want** a complete working healthcare claims validation system that can be deployed, demonstrated, and cleaned up within 5 minutes,
**so that** I can evaluate technical credibility and business value of AI-powered healthcare cost reduction (60% savings demonstration).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete Infrastructure Deployment**: System deploys all AWS resources (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront) via single `make demo` command within 60 seconds
2. **Working Claims Validation**: Process demo healthcare claim (CT scan for chronic back pain) using OpenAI GPT-4 medical reasoning and return validation results within 2 minutes
3. **Executive Dashboard Interface**: React SPA displays validation results with confidence scores, cost reduction metrics, and processing time in healthcare-professional styling
4. **NVIDIA Compliance Integration**: Integrate NVIDIA AI Enterprise API for compliance checking and governance validation of claims processing
5. **Audit Trail Generation**: All validation decisions logged to CloudWatch with timestamps, user context, and AI reasoning for regulatory compliance demonstration
6. **Cost Tracking & Budget Control**: Real-time cost tracking displayed in dashboard with automatic shutdown if approaching $50 demonstration budget
7. **Complete Cleanup Automation**: `make cleanup` command executes Terraform destroy and confirms zero ongoing AWS costs within 60 seconds
8. **Comprehensive Testing**: 85% test coverage with pytest (backend) and Vitest (frontend) including OpenAI/NVIDIA API mocking
9. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: 2-stage pipeline (Build/Test → Deploy/Validate) with automated quality gates and deployment validation
10. **Executive Presentation Ready**: System generates screenshot-ready validation results and cost savings summary suitable for stakeholder presentations
