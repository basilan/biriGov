# Healthcare AI Governance Agent Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Successfully demonstrate hands-on AI implementation expertise through working healthcare claims validation system
- Achieve 60% cost reduction demonstration from $15-25 per claim manual process to automated validation
- Support executive role acquisition (Chief AI Officer, Field CTO) by proving technical depth alongside strategic vision
- Complete working system within 20-25 hour constraint demonstrating Principal Engineer scope discipline
- Execute repeatable demonstrations (<5 minutes, <$50 cost) for multiple executive stakeholder audiences
- Establish foundational template for replicating demonstration-first approach across remaining 4 AI patterns

### Background Context

Healthcare payers process over 4 billion medical claims annually, each requiring validation against complex medical necessity guidelines. Current manual processes cost $15-25 per claim with 3-7 day processing delays and 15-20% reviewer inconsistency. The Healthcare AI Governance Agent addresses this challenge through a demonstration-first implementation combining OpenAI RAG medical reasoning with NVIDIA AI Enterprise compliance frameworks.

This implementation serves dual strategic purposes: delivering tangible business value proof points for healthcare industry conversations while establishing technical credibility for senior executive positioning. The system demonstrates enterprise-grade AI development practices (TDD, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code) within cost-controlled, rapidly deployable architecture suitable for executive presentations and stakeholder validation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Executive-First Interface Design**: The interface prioritizes clarity and business impact over technical complexity, designed specifically for C-suite healthcare executives and technology leaders who need immediate comprehension of AI validation results and business value proposition. The interface serves as a presentation tool during stakeholder meetings rather than an operational dashboard.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-Click Demonstration**: Single button initiates complete validation workflow with real-time progress indicators
- **Business Metrics First**: Cost savings, processing time, and confidence scores prominently displayed with visual comparisons to manual processes  
- **Executive Narrative Flow**: Interface guides viewers through validation logic, business impact, and technical credibility in logical presentation sequence
- **Minimal Technical Exposure**: Raw API responses, logs, and technical details hidden unless specifically requested for technical stakeholder discussions

### Core Screens and Views

- **Landing Page**: Executive summary with demo initiation, system status, and business case overview
- **Validation Progress**: Real-time processing indicators showing OpenAI reasoning and NVIDIA compliance checking
- **Results Dashboard**: Primary view displaying claim validation results with confidence scoring, cost analysis, and processing metrics
- **Business Case Summary**: ROI calculations, cost reduction projections, and industry benchmark comparisons
- **Technical Details (Optional)**: Expandable section showing API responses, audit logs, and technical implementation details for engineering stakeholders

### Accessibility: None

Given the demonstration-focused scope and executive stakeholder audience, formal accessibility compliance is not required. Interface will support standard web browser accessibility features but WCAG compliance is out of scope for MVP demonstration system.

### Branding

**Professional Healthcare Technology Aesthetic**: Clean, medical-grade interface styling with subtle healthcare industry color palette (blues, whites, muted greens). Interface should convey enterprise reliability and regulatory compliance readiness without appearing clinical or sterile. Emphasis on business credibility and technical sophistication.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Executive Meeting Optimized**: Primary design for laptop/desktop presentation during executive meetings with responsive support for tablet viewing during stakeholder discussions. Mobile support secondary priority - system designed for conference room demonstrations rather than mobile usage.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Single Repository Approach**: All components (Python code, Terraform infrastructure, tests, documentation) maintained within single GitHub repository for demonstration simplicity and deployment coordination. This approach supports the 20-25 hour implementation constraint by eliminating cross-repository dependencies and complex integration workflows.

### Service Architecture

**Demonstration-Focused Monolithic Design**: Single AWS Lambda function containing HealthcareClaimsValidator class with integrated OpenAI and NVIDIA API calls. This architecture prioritizes demonstration reliability and cost control over production scalability. No microservices complexity - all functionality contained within unified codebase deployable as single Lambda function with supporting S3 storage and web interface.

### Testing Requirements

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Comprehensive Coverage**: Full testing pyramid implementation including unit tests (pytest), integration tests (API mocking), and end-to-end deployment validation. Minimum 85% code coverage enforced via GitHub Actions quality gates. Testing strategy designed to support professional development practices demonstration while ensuring reliable stakeholder presentations.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Developer Self-Service Interface**: **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT** - System must support two developer usage patterns:
  1. **Primary: Git Clone Development** - Developers can `git clone https://github.com/basilan/birigov`, run setup commands, build/deploy/demonstrate, and cleanly undeploy without manual intervention
  2. **Secondary: NPM Package Installation** - Future enhancement allowing `npm install` or `npx` execution for demonstration-only usage without source code access
- **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Average software engineer with 2-3 years experience must complete full demonstration cycle without external assistance or troubleshooting support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Self-service documentation including prerequisites, setup steps, troubleshooting guide, and complete cleanup procedures ensuring no ongoing AWS costs
- **Development Environment**: VS Code with ClaudeCode integration for AI-assisted development and rapid prototyping
- **Infrastructure as Code**: 100% Terraform-managed AWS resources with automated deployment and cleanup workflows via simple command interface
- **Python Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+ with enterprise coding standards, type hints, professional package structure, and dependency management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions 2-stage pipeline (Build/Test → Deploy/Validate) with automated security scanning, code quality validation, and deployment verification
- **API Integration Strategy**: Direct API calls to OpenAI and NVIDIA services without persistent caching or complex retry logic - optimized for demonstration execution rather than production resilience  
- **Cost Optimization Approach**: AWS Lambda pay-per-execution model with S3 lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup, API call optimization for minimal token usage
- **Security Framework**: AWS IAM least-privilege access, environment variable API key management, basic encryption at rest - sufficient for demonstration context without full production security compliance
- **Build System**: Professional Makefile with intuitive targets (`make demo`, `make clean`, `make test`) designed for developer self-service operation
- **Developer Contribution Support**: Repository structure and documentation supporting external developers submitting enhancements, bug reports, and pull requests
