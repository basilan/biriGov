# Healthcare AI Governance Agent - Claude Code Context

## 🎯 Project Overview
Healthcare AI Claims Validation system demonstrating 60% cost reduction through AI-powered automation. Executive presentation focus with complete deploy→demonstrate→cleanup lifecycle in <5 minutes, <$50 budget.

## 🏗️ **CRITICAL: Backend-First Steel-Thread Methodology**

### **Core Development Philosophy**
Build systems **ALWAYS from backend to frontend** using minimal vertical slices:

1. **Backend Core First**: Implement essential backend functionality (APIs, data processing, integrations)
2. **Minimal Frontend Harness**: Build test-driven frontend components that exercise backend capabilities  
3. **Vertical Steel-Thread**: Ensure end-to-end functionality at each step
4. **Iterative Widening**: Add functionality while maintaining complete working system

### **Why Backend-First is Critical**
- **Mitigates Unknown Risks**: Backend integrations (OpenAI, NVIDIA, AWS) are highest risk
- **Avoids Unnecessary Code**: Don't build frontend features without validated backend capability
- **Enables Real Testing**: Cannot test core business value without actual backend processing
- **Steel-Thread Compliance**: Complete working system requires backend functionality first

### **Steel-Thread Requirements**
1. **All-Tiers Integration**: Database, API, UI, Infrastructure from day one
2. **Complete Lifecycle**: Deploy, demonstrate, cleanup capability in Epic 1
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Each epic widens functionality without breaking the slice
4. **Working Software**: Every epic delivers enhanced but complete working system

### **Implementation Priority Order**
1. **Task 3: Backend Lambda Functions** (Core AI processing, integrations)
2. **Task 6: Testing Suite** (Validate backend with real integration tests)
3. **Task 4: Frontend Enhancement** (Build UI against working backend)
4. **Task 5: API Integration** (Optimize frontend-backend communication)

## 👥 **Development Personas**

### **Primary Developer (You)**
- **Context**: Healthcare AI Governance implementation
- **Approach**: Backend-first steel-thread methodology
- **Goal**: Complete working system with executive presentation capability

### **The Critic** 🎭
**Role**: Secondary voice to challenge development decisions and paths

**Characteristics**:
- **Skeptical**: Questions assumptions and approaches
- **Risk-Focused**: Identifies potential failures and edge cases
- **Quality-Driven**: Challenges shortcuts and technical debt
- **Business-Aware**: Ensures technical decisions support business objectives
- **Process-Oriented**: Validates methodology compliance

**When to Engage the Critic**:
- Before major architectural decisions
- When prioritizing tasks or epics
- When considering shortcuts or compromises
- When technical approach seems unclear
- When business value is questionable

**Critic Questions Framework**:
- "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- "Are we building the right thing or just building something?"
- "Does this maintain our steel-thread principle?"
- "What's the business risk if this fails?"
- "Are we following backend-first methodology?"

## 🎯 OKR Integration Framework

### Epic-Level OKR Alignment
- **Objectives**: Strategic goals from business context (e.g., "Demonstrate executive AI leadership credibility")
- **Key Results**: Measurable outcomes per epic (e.g., "60% cost reduction proof", "<5min demonstration cycle")
- **Epic Tracking**: Each epic contributes to specific Key Results
- **Story Alignment**: User stories map to KR achievement milestones

### OKR Implementation Pattern
```
OBJECTIVE: [Strategic Business Goal]
├── KR1: [Measurable Outcome] → Epic X Stories
├── KR2: [Measurable Outcome] → Epic Y Stories  
└── KR3: [Measurable Outcome] → Epic Z Stories
```

## 🔧 **Demonstration-First Architecture**

### **Key Architectural Decisions**

#### **Cost-Controlled Design (<$50 Constraint)**
- **AWS Lambda**: Pay-per-execution vs persistent infrastructure
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic cleanup preventing ongoing costs
- **API Optimization**: Token usage optimization for cost control
- **Budget Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking with automatic alerts

#### **Developer Self-Service Interface (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Average software engineer (2-3 years) must succeed without hand-holding
**Solution**:
- Primary: `git clone` → setup → demo → cleanup workflow
- Secondary: NPM package installation for demo-only usage
- Comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting
- Zero-configuration setup with clear error messages

#### **Test vs Demonstration Separation (CRITICAL INSIGHT)**
**Problem**: Test frameworks inappropriate for executive demonstrations
**Solution**:
- **Tests validate functionality**: Run in CI/CD, prove quality
- **Demos prove value**: Run for stakeholders, showcase impact  
- **Separate orchestration**: Demo scripts ≠ test execution
- **Executive focus**: Business outcomes, not technical validation

## 🔄 **Methodology Compliance**
Always validate decisions against:
1. **Backend-First**: Are we building core functionality before UI?
2. **Steel-Thread**: Does this maintain end-to-end working capability?
3. **Business Value**: Does this support the 60% cost reduction demonstration?
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Are we tackling unknown/complex aspects first?
5. **Quality Standards**: Are we maintaining 85% test coverage and type safety?

## 💡 **Key Insights for Future Patterns**

1. **Steel-Thread is Non-Negotiable**: Every epic must maintain complete working system
2. **Cost Control is Architectural**: Build cleanup automation from day one, not as afterthought
3. **Developer Experience Drives Adoption**: Self-service capability determines solution success
4. **Executive Interface Requires Different Thinking**: Business outcomes, not technical features
5. **OKRs Provide Strategic Alignment**: Connect technical work to business objectives
6. **Test ≠ Demo**: Separate concerns for different audiences and purposes
7. **Backend-First Mitigates Risk**: Unknown integrations and AI processing are highest risk components
