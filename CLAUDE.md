# Healthcare AI Governance Agent - Development Context

## ðŸ“‹ **Configuration Structure**

This project uses a modular Claude Code context configuration:

1. **[CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL.md](./CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL.md)** - Universal development methodology and steel-thread practices
2. **[CLAUDE_PROJECT.md](./CLAUDE_PROJECT.md)** - Healthcare AI-specific context and business requirements
3. **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - This reference file (you are here)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Summary**
Healthcare AI Claims Validation system demonstrating 60% cost reduction through AI-powered automation. Executive presentation focus with complete deployâ†’demonstrateâ†’cleanup lifecycle in <5 minutes, <$50 budget.

## ðŸ”„ **Universal Methodology Compliance**

### **Methodology Compliance Checklist**
Always validate decisions against:
1. **Backend-First**: Are we building core functionality before UI?
2. **Steel-Thread**: Does this maintain end-to-end working capability?
3. **Business Value**: Does this support the 60% cost reduction demonstration?
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Are we tackling unknown/complex aspects first?
5. **Quality Standards**: Are we maintaining 85% test coverage and type safety?
6. **Security Integration**: Does this include mandatory vulnerability scanning?
7. **Professional Automation**: Are we using Makefile targets (NO manual CLI commands)?
